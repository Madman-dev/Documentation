 - how to break down a feature into an intuitive workflow
 - how to design a navigation hierarchy for an app
 - where to learn more about interface conventions
 
 
 to build Googood apps, I have to become comfortable and understand when and how to use UI Objects in a familiar way
 The fundamental 6 characteristics that I need to keep in mind is...
 
 1. Aesthetic integrity
 the appearance and behavior should make sense for its goal and its purpose. an app that helps people perfom serious task can keep them focused by using subtle graphics, standard controls and predictable interactions. entertaining apps such as games can sport a captivating appearance that promises fun and excitement - while encouraging discovery
 
 2. consistency
 use well known icons, standard text styles, and uniform terminology to enable people to expect what to do next.
 
 if you're designing a workflow for completing an order in an e-commerce app - take a look at the checkout flow of popular e-commerce apps. you shouldn't be copying other apps for no reason. But you can use a good example as a starting point for your design.
 
 3. direct manipulation
 through direct manipulation users can see immediate, visible result of their action.
 
 4. feedback
 users should never wonder if an app responded to their actions. make sure the app provides a noticeable feedback. alers animations etc
 
 5. metaphors
 apps object and actions are metaphors that allows users to catch up on what's going to happen. Computers in home screen is called desktop as during the early version of GI, they were intended to help users feel at home during the new computing paradigm.
 
 6. user control
 Before apps, there are the users. The users should always make the important decision. You have to give users decision making powers without bombarding them with alerts and options at every juncture.
